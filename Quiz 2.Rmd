1.	Make data frame with only first, last, F, height, weight, # zombies killed
```{r}
library(dplyr) 
library(tidyr)
library(curl)
z <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN597_Fall17/zombies.csv")
z <- read.csv(z, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
z<- tbl_df(z)
z1<- z%>%
  filter(gender=="Female") %>%
  select(first_name, last_name, gender, height, weight, zombies_killed)
```

2.	What is mean in # zombies killed for > or = 5’5’’ and less than 5’5’’

```{r}
5*12+5 #65 is 5'5''
ztall<-filter(z1, height>=65)
zshort<-filter(z1, height<65)
mean(ztall$zombies_killed)
mean(zshort$zombies_killed)
```

3.	Graph this 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# I don't know how to make a new column based on height. I want to learn this. I need it all the time. 

#b<-ggplot(z1, aes(height, zombies_killed))
```
